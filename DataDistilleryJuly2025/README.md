The DDKG is accessible through multiple channels. Complete graph builds, including Docker images and component CSV loading files, are available at ubkg-downloads.xconsortia.org. Access requires a free UMLS license key, which can be obtained by registering at https://uts.nlm.nih.gov/uts/signup-login. For interactive exploration, the DDKG-UI (https://dd-kg-ui.cfde.cloud/) provides a web-based interface with guided queries and visualizations, supporting a curated subset of cross-domain search and retrieval tasks.
